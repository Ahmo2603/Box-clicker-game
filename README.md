# Box-clicker-game
This is a game in which the speed of clicking on a box is measured in seconds.

This is a box clicker game I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
At the start of the game there is a centered div which acts as the playing field. 
Below the playing field is a HTML div element which contains the messages for the player.

The player starts the game by clicking on the red box inside the playing field.
The red box then dissapears and appears again on random positions inside the playing field.
Each time the player clicks on the red box they get a message indicating how many seconds it took them to click on the red box.
